This assignment took me about 3.5 hours to do (including the time on studying, designing, and writing the code).

My secret code from section 2.1 was: 17aa0f7150

- Optional: I had unexpected difficulty with: recognizing 'socket' is the inheritance of 'file descriptor', which is a bit different concept intuitively for implementing webget.

- Optional: I think you could make this lab better by: [describe]

- Optional: I was surprised by: [describe]

- Optional: I'm not sure about: I've implemented byte_stream with string, but I am not sure it is the most efficient way or design.
