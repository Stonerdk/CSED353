This assignment took me about 2 hours to do (including the time on studying, designing, and writing the code).

If you used any part of best-submission codes, specify all the best-submission numbers that you used (e.g., 1, 2): 4

- **Caution**: If you have no idea about above best-submission item, please refer the Assignment PDF for detailed description.

Solo portion:

**Did your implementation successfully start and end a conversation with another copy of itself?**

- yes

**Did it successfully transfer a one-megabyte file, with contents identical upon receipt?**
- It didn't work first, but after I replaced assn4 best code, then it works.

**Please describe what code changes, if any, were necessary to pass these steps.**
- Assn4 best code

Group portion:

**What is your team’s name? Who is your partner (and what is their POVIS ID)?**

**Did your implementations successfully start and end a conversation with each other (with each implementation acting as “client” or as “server”)?**

- yes

**Did you successfully transfer a one-megabyte file between your two implementations, with contents identical upon receipt?**

- yes

**Please describe what code changes, if any, were necessary to pass these steps, either by you or your partner.**
- **Me**: It didn't work first, but after I replaced assn4 best code, then it works.
- **Juyeon**: this is repeat of solo part. I used assignment 4's best submission code (which was main part of connection), and these problems solved successfully. Please check tcp_sender.hh, tcp_sender.cc, tcp_connection.hh, tcp_connection.cc.

- Optional: I had unexpected difficulty with: 금방 끝날 줄 알았습니다.

- Optional: I think you could make this assignment better by: 아무래도 제 tcp connection에 문제가 있는 듯 한데, 어디서 그 문제가 발생하는지 확인해 보아야 할 것 같습니다. 또, 파일을 보내는 시간이 파트너에 비해 3배 느렸는데 이것도 이유가 뭔지 확인해 보아야 할 것 같습니다.

- Optional: I was surprised by: [describe]

- Optional: I'm not sure about: [describe]
